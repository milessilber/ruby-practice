# JS Libraries

Working with JavaScript libraries can give you a lot of bang for your buck. JavaScript is necessary to incorporate visual flashiness to your page!
However, using JavaScript libraries can be fairly tricky. Sometimes the library is new and isn’t documented well. Sometimes the library itself takes a lot of knowledge to use well.
Nevertheless, this should not deter you from finding cool libraries and experimenting with them. You currently know enough to tinker with ANY javascript library.

### Exercise

You can do this exercise outside of a Vue app (in a regular ol' index.html file) and then try to move the logic into a new Vue app you create.

In the spirit of tinkering and experimentation, you'll choose a JavaScript library from:
https://www.javascripting.com/user-interface/

Once you find a javascript library you want to incorporate, do the following steps:

1. Find a “getting started” tutorial, complete with installation instructions.
2. Follow the tutorial to see it working, even if you don’t understand every step.
3. Experiment with the code to try to understand it better.
4. Find more examples and get them working in your code.
5. Find and read the documentation to understand other available features and how they work.

Once you have a basic example working, create a new Vue app called `example-js-library-app` (follow the Vue CRUD guide to get started) and attempt to move the logic into a Vue component.

#### Deliverable

Add the example-js-library-app repository to your github account.

Then, go to the `js_libraries_solution.md` file and link your repository and answer the questions.

Once you've completed the assignment, do this in the independent practice repository:

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
