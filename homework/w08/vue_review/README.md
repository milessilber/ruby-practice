# Vue Review

We've learned a lot about building frontend applications. Now we're going to put together everything we've learned so far by creating a new backend and a new frontend to practice full stack architecture. 

This is going to cover 


### Exercise


Use the VueJS CRUD Cheat Sheet to create multi-page CRUD for movies (this can be done in the movie-vue-app you already have).

1. Setup the backend (making sure to test the movies API)
2. Make a separate frontend page for the movies index action
3. Make a separate frontend page for the movies new and create actions
4. Make a separate frontend page for the movies show action
5. Make a separate frontend page for the movies edit and update actions
6. Add the destroy button to the movies edit page
7. Test all the actions to make sure they're working properly


#### Deliverable
Update your movie-vue-app on github by doing a git add, commit, and push.

Then, go to the vue_crud_solution.md file in this folder and follow the instructions! Once you've completed the assignment, do this in the independent practice repository:

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
$ git push origin YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-GOES-HERE
```
